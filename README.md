# css_only_loading_bar
This is an example of how to create animated loading bars using only HTML and CSS

Inspired by an episode of Laracasts where the host used only HTML and CSS to create a circular bar that would fill in a specified percentage, I expanded upon that concept and used CSS animations to animate the loading bar, then I added a horizontal bar as well.

The animation code looks a little ugly because of the constraint to only use CSS, but something like SASS has the potential to clean up the code considerably.
